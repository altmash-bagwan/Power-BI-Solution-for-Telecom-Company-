# Power-BI-Solution-for-Telecom-Company

This project is completed during the PwC Digital Accelerator Program, aimed to provide a Power BI solution to a Telecom Company. The project had three key deliverables:

 1) Call Center Data Dashboard: A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and analyze call center data.
 2) Telecom Customer Churn Analysis: A BI solution was developed to understand and predict customer churn.
 3) Diversity and Inclusion Analysis: An analysis was conducted to understand diversity and inclusion within the organization.

### 1. Analysis of Call Centre’s Data : 

Report covers an analysis of call data from call center. The aim was to track the
process and performance of agents. 

#### Overview of Call Data :

  #### Total no of calls received : 5000
  #### Call Topics with count of call received:
* Technical Support: 1019
* Streaming: 1022
* Payment related: 1007
* Contract related: 976
* Admin Support: 976
  

#### Key Findings

* Out of the total calls received, 4054 were answered, with a total of 3646 calls
resolved.
* The average call satisfaction rating was 3.4/5, which is below the
ideal/recommended call satisfaction rate of 4.5.
* The average speed of answer by an agent was 54.75 seconds.
* There were several unanswered calls across different topics, with Technical
Support contributing the most with 214 unanswered calls.

#### Detailed Breakdown by Topic : 
| Topic | # Calls Unanswered | # Calls Resolved | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| Technical Support | 214 | 736 |
| Streaming | 175 | 749 | 
| Payment related | 189 |  729 | 
| Contract related | 187 | 729 | 
| Admin Support | 181 | 723 |  

#### Call Resolution Details 

The call resolution rate by agents varied from 88% to 91%, which is below the
ideal/recommended benchmark of call resolution rate of 95%.

#### Implications and Recommendations

Given these findings, there are several areas where performance can be improved:

1. Improve Call Satisfaction: With an average rating of 3.4/5, there is room for improvement in customer satisfaction. Training programs focusing on customer handling and problem-solving can be beneficial.
2. Reduce Unanswered Calls: The number of unanswered calls, especially in Technical Support, is a concern. Allocating more resources or improving efficiency in these areas could help reduce the number of unanswered calls.
3. Increase Call Resolution Rate: The call resolution rate is below the ideal benchmark. Strategies to improve this could include additional training for agents or reviewing the current processes for potential inefficiencies.

### 2. Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 

#### What is Customer Churn?

Customer Churn refers to the natural business cycle of losing and acquiring customers. Every company — no matter the quality of its products or customer service experiences churn. In the context of businesses, customer churn can occur due to factors such as dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offerings, or changes in circumstances or preferences of the customer. Generally speaking, the less churn a company has, the more customers they keep.

#####  The report provided a clear and interactive way to communicate my findings, helping the client to better understand their customer behavior and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.


#### Key Insights :

##### From Customer Base : 

* There is almost equal number of male - female in customer base.

### Recommendations

* Provide incentives for customers to switch from month-to-month contracts to longer-term contracts.
* Provide senior citizens with tailored offers and services that address their unique needs and concerns to reduce churn rates.
* Focus on retaining female customers with month-to-month contracts, as they appear to be more likely to churn than male customers with the same contract type.
* Offer convenient payment options and automate payment processes to reduce the number of customers who churn due to manual payment mode.
* Address the reasons behind the churn of customers with fiber optic internet to reduce the high churn rate among this customer segment.
